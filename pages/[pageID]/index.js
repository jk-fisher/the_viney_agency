The agency represents a diverse range of clients writing across a wide range of subjects. \n I first started in the book trade as a bookseller and then enjoyed a twenty-five-year career in general trade publishing, mostly working in international sales and marketing, later becoming a board director at a major British publishing house.\n Being a literary agent combines my love of books and an enjoyment of business while enabling me to work very closely with our wonderful authors and manage their careers across all media.",

I am also very interested in a broad range of lively and original non-fiction, particularly in the areas of narrative non-fiction, biography, memoir and cookery. I am also developing a children’s and young adult fiction list. \n I joined The Viney Agency in 2021, having spent the previous five years at the Abner Stein literary agency. Before that I worked in editorial at Kyle Books publishing house.",
