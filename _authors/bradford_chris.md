Chris Bradford is a multi-million copy bestselling author who is renowned for his live events and for practising 'method writing'. 



For his award-winning Young Samurai series, he trained in samurai swordsmanship, karate, ninjutsu and earned his black belt in Zen Kyu Shin Taijutsu. 



For his Bodyguard series, he embarked on an intensive close-protection course to become a qualified professional bodyguard. 



And for the Soul trilogy, Chris travelled extensively to experience first-hand the cultures featured in the story-from living with the Shona people in Zimbabwe, to trekking the Inca trail, to meditating in a Buddhist temple amid the mountains of Japan.



His 3 + million selling books are published in over twenty-five languages and have garnered more than thirty-five children's book awards and nominations.  Young Samurai: The Way of the Warrior was deemed one of Puffin's 70 Best Ever Books, alongside Treasure Island and Robin Hood.
