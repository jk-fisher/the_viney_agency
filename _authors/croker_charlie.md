Several years ago, someone told Charlie Croker about a Japanese car hire leaflet that read 'When passenger of foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your passage then tootle him with vigor.' A short while later Croker found himself on a ferry to the Spanish island of La Gomera, reading the instruction 'Keep this ticket up the end of your trip' and found himself thinking 'there might be a book in this …'

Croker's great love is for the telling detail - be it a mistake on a French menu ('apple grumble'), or a statistic about his beloved Britain, such as the fact that over 2,000 of its listed buildings are red telephone boxes.

His third magnificent compendium of international howlers, Utterly Lost in Translation was published by Blake in 2015.
