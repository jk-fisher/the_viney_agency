David Price's early interest in aviation and military history were fuelled by days exploring deserted RAF airfields in his native Cumbria, leading to a lifelong interest in aviation history. He has been involved in aircraft preservation for over twenty-five years at the Solway Aviation Museum, serving two terms as Chairman. He writes and lectures on aviation and the First World War and is a frequent guide to battlefields. His first book, A Bomber Crew Mystery, followed the story of two American B-17 crews based in Suffolk in the Second World War..

His highly praised and bestselling The Crew - The Story of a Lancaster Crew was published by Head of Zeus in 2020. Head of Zeus published his Mosquito Men in 2022.
