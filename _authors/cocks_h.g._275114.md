I teach modern history at the University of Nottingham - that means anything since the 18th century.  I am especially interested in the history of the body and sexuality.  I've been teaching since 1998 and have written three books and numerous academic articles.  

Classified - The Secret History of the Personal Column was serialised in the Times and the Daily Mail, and also led to media appearances on the Today programme and the One Show.
