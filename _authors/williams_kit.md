Kit Williams is widely acknowledged as one of Britain's most innovative artists and craftsmen, whose highly detailed and original work is widely collected. Masquerade was published in 1979 and this intricately conceived, ground-breaking illustrated book became a global bestselling phenomenon with sales exceeding two million copies.

In 2009 Kit Williams was the subject of an hour-long BBC Four programme The Man Behind the Masquerade. He lives in seclusion in the English countryside.
