His non-fiction books have won or been shortlisted for the Blue Peter Book Award (twice), the Rhone-Poulenc Junior Prize for Science Books, and the TES Information Book Award. His Wolf Children was hailed as the 'best post-war children's novel since The Silver Sword by Amanda Craig. Dutch publishers Callenbach published his 14th novel, Out of Nowhere in 2021.

His books are sold throughout the English-speaking world and have been published in an additional ten languages.

Most of his novels are set in the 20th Century and are primarily concerned with the First or Second World War, and life under totalitarian regimes.
