Dr Denise Allen began her archaeological life as a ‘digger’, excavating throughout the 1970s, then specialised in Roman Glass (completing her PhD at Cardiff University, and later publishing the*Roman Glass in Britain, a popular introduction to the subject). She has worked in museums and taught in Continuing Education, and for nearly twenty years was a Director of Andante Travels, Britain’s leading archaeological tour company, designing the tours, writing brochures and field notes, and leading many tours.
