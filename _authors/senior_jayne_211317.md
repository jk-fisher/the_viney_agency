Jayne Senior was born in Rotherham in in 1964 and has lived there all her life. In the late 1980s she became a youth worker and later managed a council-funded project called Risky Business, which worked with young girls involved in prostitution.

Time and again, Jayne tried to alert the authorities in Rotherham to the increasing numbers of young girls being abused by men of Pakistani origin.

For almost fifteen years she was ignored, harassed, called a liar and eventually hounded from her job.

In 2014, the publication of a report into the sexual abuse of children in Rotherham concluded that as many as 1,400 girls had been victims. Finally, Jayne Senior had been vindicated.

In 2015 she was named national 'Woman of the Year' for her extraordinary work protecting minors in Rotherham. In 2016 she was awarded an MBE.

Pan Macmillan published her Broken and Betrayed - The True Story of the Rotherham Abuse Scandal by the Woman Who Fought to Expose It in 2016.
