What do the CEO's of the world's largest corporations, the planet's biggest recording artists, senior government and military officials, influential NGOs and the most maverick investors have in common? They turn to Mark Stevenson to help them make sense of, and navigate, an uncertain future - so that we might create a better one.

As an internationally renowned thinker on systems change and innovation Mark is one of the worlds' most booked speakers addressing audiences across the globe - drawing on his work helping organisations change the way they feel, think, invest and operate in order to answer the grand questions the future is asking us. Chris Anderson, TED Curator remarks, 'Stevenson wears no blindfold. His tools are curiosity, open-mindedness, clarity and reason.'

His two bestselling books, An Optimist's Tour of the Future and the award-winning We Do Things Differently are much needed shots of evidence-based optimism for our current turbulent times, mapping out existing and proven solutions to our planetary and societal dilemmas in an entertaining ideas-travelogue format. 

Alongside his governmental, corporate and NGO engagements Mark (a former stand-up) enjoys a successful side career in the worlds of comedy and music. His internationally successful podcast The Book of Revelations with comedian Jon Richardson (and co-hosted by Ed Gillespie) has enjoyed over 1m listens to date and is rated in the top 0.5% of podcasts worldwide by popularity. His farce (co-authored with Jack Milner) Octopus Soup! completed a major UK tour just before lockdown and is set to be presented internationally. He is also co-songwriter and frontman for the critically acclaimed rock band Quantum Pig who release a second album and embark on their first national tour later this year.

Mark's eclectic skillset has led to him being appointed Special Advisor on Peace, National Security and Climate Change to the UK Ministry of Defence, Futurist without Borders for Medicines Sans Frontiers (UK) and Global Ambassador for environmental law firm Client Earth amongst many other advisory roles.
