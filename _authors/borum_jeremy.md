Jeremy Borum is a film composer, orchestrator, producer, and performer. Among the first wave of working composers to see the digital de-monetization of music as a piece of history, not an on-going process, he built a successful music career in an uncertain industry that is re-inventing itself. He is credited on numerous features, shorts and albums. An active member of the Society of Composers and Lyricists, he is a contributing author to their quarterly journal The Score.

He has worked globally with many major orchestras and studios, performing or recording in about 30 countries to crowds as large as 80,000. He teaches a bi-annual intensive film scoring seminar at Citrus College in Glendora, CA and has degrees or certificates in music from Colburn School of Music in Los Angeles, CA, Berklee College of Music, the Australian National University and the University of California. He lives in California.

His first book Guerilla Film Scoring was published by Rowman & Littlefield in 2015.
