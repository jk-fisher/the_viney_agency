Andrew Jackson has written for Yahoo! Movies, music magazines such as Burn Lounge and Mean Streets, and copy edited the Hollywood monthly Ingenue.  He also directed and co-wrote the feature film The Discontents (2004) starring Perry King and Amy Madigan. 

Born in Detroit, Michigan, he played drums in garage bands before heading to Boston to graduate from Emerson College. After seeing Yellow Submarine on TV at age 4 he became a confirmed Beatlemaniac, which resulted in his first book, Still the Greatest: The 200 Best Solo Beatle Songs. The guide spotlights the best tunes by John, Paul, George, and Ringo from 1970 to 2010, giving each a 1-to-2-page entry covering the story behind the music, the people, and the times. His critically acclaimed 1965 was published by St Martin's Press in 2015.

Andrew Jackson's 1973, Rock at the Crossroads was published by St Martin's Press in 2019.

'A comprehensive account of the year of 1973 and its legendary music and momentous social change.'
