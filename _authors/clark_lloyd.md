He has appeared on many television programmes including 'Meet the Ancestors', 'Timewatch', 'Battlefield Detectives', 'Battle Plans' and 'In the Line of Fire'.

'Utterly fascinating. Lloyd Clark demonstrates his deep and wide-ranging knowledge in this compelling new look at three of the most iconic commanders of World War II. With genuinely fresh insights, immense wisdom and thought-provoking analysis, this is a superb account of these three men, divided by different nationalities but with uncanny similarities in ambition, character and motivation.'
