Aleksandr Orlov is businessman, website creator, movie mogul, boss of Sergei and now a mega-bestselling author. He comes from a long line of courageous meerkats originally from the Kalahari region.

Aleksandr Orlov has become one of the most loved figures in British culture and his catchphrase - Simples! - can be heard from the playground to the office. Written in his inimitable voice (as dictated to his sidekick Sergei), his autobiography offers the same humour as his TV ads, giving  the full story of his ancestor's 'Journey of Courageousness' from the Kalahari to Russia, the low-down on his life as entrepreneur and founder of comparethemeerkat.com and his love of grubs and cravats.

It was the number one Christmas bestseller in 2010, selling over half a million copies in the UK.
