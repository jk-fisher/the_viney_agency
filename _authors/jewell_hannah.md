Hannah Jewell is a former senior writer at BuzzFeed UK, where she became known for her humour writing about gender and her satire of UK and US politics. She presented BuzzFeed's live 2016 election night show, which was watched by nearly 7 million people. Born in the UK, she grew up in California and did her undergraduate study at UC Berkeley in Middle East Studies, then moved to the UK for an MPhil in International Relations and Politics at Cambridge. 

She is currently pop culture host for the Washington Post.

Hannah's first book, 100 Nasty Women of History combined her background in history and politics with her love of the internet to write about remarkable women of the past with an accessible, hilarious (and sometimes sweary) style. It was published by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK in 2017 and by Sourcebooks in the US in 2018 as She Caused a Riot.

Her second book, We Need Snowflakes was published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2022.
