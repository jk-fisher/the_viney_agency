David Andress is Professor of Modern History at the University of Portsmouth, where he has taught since 1994. He studied History at the University of York between 1987 and 1990, and returned there for a doctorate, awarded in 1995.

He is an internationally recognised authority on the French Revolution, and especially on the politics and culture of Paris during the upheavals of the 1790s. After writing several books focused directly on French events in these years, he diversified his publishing interests and in 2008 produced 1789, his first work of international history which explored that that fateful year, not just in France, but in Britain and its global empire and in the nascent American Republic.

This was followed by The Savage Storm telling the story of Britainï¿½s military defeat of Napoleonic France and the social and political struggles of the era and the conflicting ideas that emerged from it. His acclaimed Cultural Dementia - How The West Has Lost its History and Risks Losing Everything Else was published in 2018.

His The French Revolution - A Peasant's Revolt was published by Head of Zeus in 2020.

He lives in Hampshire.
