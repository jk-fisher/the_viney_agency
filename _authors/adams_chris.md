Chris Adams was the driving force behind folk rockers,*String Driven Thing*who made two cult albums for the Charisma label in the early Seventies. Fronting the band with his wife, they toured extensively in Europe and the States with stable-mates Genesis, opening for them on their US debut in New York City in November �72. Returning to their native Glasgow, Chris opened a recording studio and began to make a living as a songwriter. In the early Nineties he reformed the band and they were active both on the live and recording fronts.* His first book,*Hendrix�s Grail Guitar*was published by Rowman & Littlefield in 2016 to critical acclaim. Chris Adams died in 2016.
