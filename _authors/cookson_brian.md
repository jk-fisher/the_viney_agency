After obtaining a BA Honours Degree at Oxford University, I spent most of my working life as an IBM Consultant. Now a London Tourist Board Blue Badge Guide and writer and lecturer on London and the River Thames, I specialise in London walking tours.

Mainstream have published two of my books on London themes, London Waterside Walks and Crossing the River - The History of London's Thames River Bridges from Richmond to the Tower.
