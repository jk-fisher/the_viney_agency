In 1993, Graham Hoyland became the 15th Englishman to climb Everest, having become obsessed by the mountain and the myth of what happened to Mallory and Irvine. It was his evidence that eventually led to the discovery of Mallory's body and it will be his evidence that may lead to the discovery of Sandy Irvine's. His Last Hours on Everest is the most detailed reconstruction of what happened after the two English climbing legends left the camp on that fateful day. Combining personal experience, the physical evidence found on the mountain and an insight into the hearts and minds of the two climbers, Graham Hoyland produces the most compelling description of what actually happened and the answer to that most intriguing of questions - did they actually climb Everest?

His Walking Through Spring was published to critical acclaim by Collins in 2016. His Yeti - An Abominable history, on the myths and mythologies of this fabled beast, was published by William Collins in 2018. Merlin, his history of the war-wining aero engine, was published by Harper Collins in 2020.

'To get deeper into the nuts and bolts of aviation, Graham Hoyland spent a year taking apart the story of the Merlin and putting it back together in a form that roars beautifully from the very start'

-- Simon Calder, Independent

'A stirring account of how these hand-wrought machines, geared for speed and encased in elegant airframes … delivered us in 1940 … Merlin depicts a heroic age of smashed land, air and water speed records … and the extreme bravery of those pioneers, who incurred many fatalities. Hoyland marries the drama and excitement with a clear focus on the technical: he puts you in the cockpit and into the very guts of the machines … Anyone with a serious interest in engineering will find much to enjoy and appreciate.'

 -- Colin Greenwood, The Spectator
