David Whitley was born in Chester in 1984 and began composing stories shortly afterwards. His dream of writing Young Adult fiction was hugely encouraged when, at age 17 he was shortlisted for the Kathleen Fidler Award for a children's novel and at 20 he won the Cheshire Prize for Literature for a children's short story.

His acclaimed first novel, The Midnight Charter, was published by Puffin in 2009. It sold in eighteen countries and fifteen languages around the world and was longlisted for the Carnegie Medal and the Branford Boase. The sequel,  The Children of the Lost, was published in 2010 with the concluding title in the trilogy, The Canticle of Whispers, being published in 2012.
