Martin Spinelli produced award-winning news features for National Public Radio.  In the mid-1990s he produced cutting-edge pieces heard on innovative stations around the world, as well as on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4.  Both his benchmark radio art series Radio Radio and LINEbreak are included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Television and Radio in New York while all of his radio work and writing are archived in the Martin Spinelli Collection at the University at Buffalo Library.

Martin holds degrees from the University of Sussex and Virginia Tech as well as a PhD from Buffalo.  He was the founder of the Academic Radio Program at the City University of New York at Brooklyn College where he produced the AIDS-informational soap Welcome to America broadcast on Radio Africa International.  His many essays about media art and history have been published in anthologies as well as journals like Postmodern Culture, Convergence and Object.

In September 2006 Martin's life was transformed when his wife was killed, and his son nearly killed by a lorry driver who fell asleep at the wheel. His memoir After the Crash, tells the story of their recovery.
