---
Helen Newlove was born in 1961 and grew up in the close community of Irlam, Manchester, a place which respected the values of hard work and good neighbourliness. When she was 20, she met Garry Newlove at a local disco. They married in June 1986 and had three daughters. On August 10 2007 her husband was brutally beaten by a gang of youths outside the family home in Warrington. He died two days later. It was an act of violence that shocked the nation and would have a profound impact on the lives of Helen and their children. 



When Helen Newlove left school at sixteen she never imagined that one day she would take a seat in the House of Lords. As Baroness Newlove of Warrington she is a tireless campaigner against anti-social behaviour and for the rights of victims and witnesses. She is the UK Government's Champion for Active and Safer Communities, tasked with a special interest in tackling underage drinking and related anti-social behaviour. In 2021 she was appointed Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. 



It Could Happen to You is a record for her future grandchildren of the grandfather they will never know. But it is also about coming up from the black pit of despair and meeting challenges that might have looked impossible before. 



Helen Newlove's inspiring story is not one of politics and committees; it is about real people and the impact that crime and anti-social behaviour has on us all.
