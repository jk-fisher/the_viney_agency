I grew up in London and between 1973 and 1976 worked for one rock magazine and freelanced for several others. My fist book, which grew out of the rock journalism, was Future Rock published in 1975.  Since then, I have worked as a freelance book writer.  In this period the books mostly alternated between modern culture (rock music and movies) or political/military history, but I also wrote two works of 'faction' - the WW2 alternative history The Moscow Option and the forward-looking Russian Revolution 1985.  In 1987 my first thriller The Red Eagles was published in the US.  My Jack of Spies was published on both sides of the Atlantic in 2014. The sequel, One Man's Flag was published in 2015 with the third volume, Lenin's Roller Coaster published in 2017. 

I have written eight volumes of the John Russell series of espionage thrillers and Sealing Their Fate a military history. 

The stand-alone spy story The Diary of a Dead Man on Leave was published by Soho Press in the US in 2019.

Wedding Station, the seventh volume of the Station series (a prequel to Zoo Station) was published by Soho Press and Old Street in the UK in 2021.

Union Station, the eighth and concluding volume in the series will be published in 2023.
