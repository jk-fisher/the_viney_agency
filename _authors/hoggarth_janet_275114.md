Janet Hoggarth has worked on a chicken farm, as a bookseller, a children's book editor, a children's author, and as a DJ (under the name of Whitney and Britney). Her first children's book The Whole Joke Book was Bloomsbury Children's Books bestselling title until Harry Potter knocked it of its perch. After the writing bug bit her she published several other children's books, more recently under the pseudonym of Jess Bright. Her first novel for adults, The Single Mums' Mansion, reached the number one slot on the Amazon fiction charts and has been optioned for TV by Slam Productions. Two more books subsequently joined the series: The Single Mums Move On and The Single Mums' Secrets. 

Her latest book Who Do You Think You Are Maggie Pink? was published by Boldwood to rave reviews in 2022.          

Janet lives with her husband, three children and an extremely needy ginger cat in East Dulwich, London.
