Failing antibiotics have shifted society online. As big tech companies begin to dominate life, the boundaries between real and virtual have blurred. At 14, Jess is attending school for the first time. Meeting other children and making real friends is something she's dreamed of for years. But Jess misses her family, especially her sister Chloe, who is in poor health.

With Chloe's sickness worsening and her medication getting more expensive, Jess turns to the digital world to fix things. She is a brilliant coder and programmer. Desperate to help her sister, Jess dives into classified territory and discovers explosive truths. Truths which reveal just how manipulated reality has become.

With her family's lives in the balance, Jess must defy everything she's been told to help them - before it's too late.
