Why do some organisations thrive while others seem paralysed by inaction? How do we become more innovative?

The Power of Us is the result of a three-year journey around the world seeking out highly successful companies from BrewDog and Patagonia to inner city schools and renewable energy co-ops to find the answers.

Cultivating people-powered innovation enables everyone to collaboratively work to figure things out. We just need to nurture the mindset and culture that makes innovation an everyday occurrence. Thought-provoking and incisive, The Power of Us is an urgent call for leaders, teams and individuals to challenge the status quo, transform our lives and rebuild a better world for the future.
