Afghanistan was the only war in NATO’s 70-year history called under its founding principle: that an attack on one is considered an attack on all. Holding together this complex coalition after 9/11 was a unique leadership challenge, calling on highly developed political and military skills. The Generals had to fight the Taliban and absorb the complex politics of Washington, Brussels and Kabul; lead troops in the field, while grappling with the multi-dimensional puzzles of the most significant geopolitical event of our time.
The Long War tells the story of the daily crises that they faced - assassinations, coup attempts, prison breaks, political betrayals, civilian casualties, political events beyond their control - while being responsible for thousands of young American and European lives.
