For the first time in forty years the UK-based bereavement charity Sands (the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society) breaks wide open the public silence which imprisons families living with the loss of a baby through stillbirth or neo-natal complications and challenges the taboos surrounding a loss that nobody affected can find the words for.

Loving you from here features the moving stories of multpile families; some affected recently, some decades ago, but still living with the loss. The book is a practical guide for grieving parents in the grips of tragedy, and those around them who want to be able to offer support.

This profound and insightful book will help everyone impacted by the loss of a baby.
