The heart-rending story of a young boy's miraculous recovery from severe brain damage and the loss of his mother following a car accident.

'In the pit of my stomach, as I kissed my four-year-old son Lio and my darling wife Sasha goodbye, I knew something was up. By that evening, the police had told me about the crash.Lio's bright and talented mother was killed that day, and he narrowly escaped the same fate. But instead of it being an ending for us, the crash was a beginning. Lio's miraculous recovery from severe brain damage and a coma defied medical science. As I witnessed his astonishing journey - from intensive care to school and 10 Downing Street - and fought to pull him back from the edge of death and the loss of his mother, I found real purpose and meaning for the first time in my life.'

After the Crash is much more than a moving personal story. It's a handbook for dealing with disaster, not just surviving it but mastering it and using it to transform your life for the better.
