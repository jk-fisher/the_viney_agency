The true inside story of key command personalities driving the Afghan War―the longest war in America's history.

David Loyn's The Long War tells the story of the eight Generals (seven American, one British) who led the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan. This was a high profile, increasingly complex role. Generals including David Petraeus, Stanley McChrystal, David McKiernan, and Dan McNeill are interviewed about their command of the war. They had military experience going back to Vietnam, but were now to be tested in battle as never before. McChrystal had the reputation of a 'warrior monk' and is considered one of the most gifted military leaders of his generation.

Afghanistan was the only war in NATO's 70-year history called under its founding principle: that an attack on one is considered an attack on all. Holding together this complex coalition after 9/11 was a unique leadership challenge, calling on highly developed political and military skills. The Generals had to fight the Taliban and absorb the complex politics of Washington, Brussels and Kabul; lead troops in the field, while grappling with the multi-dimensional puzzles of the most significant geopolitical event of our time.

The Long War tells the story of the daily crises that they faced―assassinations, coup attempts, prison breaks, political betrayals, civilian casualties, political events beyond their control―while being responsible for thousands of young American and European lives.
