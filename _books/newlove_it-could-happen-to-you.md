When Helen was 20, she met Garry Newlove at a local disco. They married in 1986 and had three daughters. On 10 August 2007, Garry was brutally beaten by a gang of youths outside the family home in Warrington. He died two days later. It was an act of violence that shocked the nation and would have a profound impact on the lives of Helen and her children.

After the ordeal of a ten-week trial and the murder conviction of three youths, Helen held a press conference, giving a speech that attracted national media attention and propelled her into the role of a campaigner for victims' rights and against the lawlessness that blights so many of our towns and cities.

In 2010, Helen was appointed to the House of Lords as Baroness Newlove of Warrington, a tireless campaigner against anti-social behaviour and for the rights of victims and witnesses.

In this engaging memoir, Helen recounts how her family was shattered by Garry's murder and how good unexpectedly came out of evil. Her remarkable story is not one of politics and committees; it is about real people and the impact that crime has on us all.
