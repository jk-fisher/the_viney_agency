HSBC is one of the biggest banks in the world with over 40 million customers. In the first decade of the 21st century those customers included El Chapo and the Sinaloa cartel, one of the most notorious criminal organisations in the world. Too Big To Jail tells the extraordinary story of how HSBC became the Mexican drug cartel's bank of choice and how they helped turn ill-gotten money into clean dollars.

Beginning in Hong Kong and ranging across London, Washington, the Cayman Islands and Mexico, where HSBC saw the opportunity to become the largest bank in the world, and El Chapo seized the chance to fuel his murderous empire by laundering his drug proceeds through the bank. For its role in the affair HSBC received a record $1.9 Billion fine from authorities in the US, but crucially not a single person went to prison. Too Big To Jail brings together an extraordinary cast of politicians, bankers, drug dealers, FBI officers and whistle-blowers to tell the story, and asks the age-old question; what price does greed have?
