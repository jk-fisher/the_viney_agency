The Viney Agency is a London-based literary agency founded in 2008. The agency represents a diverse range of authors primarily handling their book deals with publishers worldwide, and providing a full range of services including selling film and TV options to broadcasters and production companies.

The Viney Agency represents over 100 authors, writing across many genres, including adult and children's fiction and a wide variety of narrative non-fiction and biography.

We work closely with our clients and are committed to providing editorial support in the shaping of manuscripts. Ultimately successful agenting is about selling and we pride ourselves on being a very sales-led agency.

We sell English language rights directly to the United Kingdom and North America.

Foreign language sales are handled by the UK’s leading foreign rights team at Intercontinental Literary Agency (ILA).

Dramatic rights are handled by the London-based Knight Hall Agency or The Artists Partnership.

The Viney Agency is a member of the Association of Authors’ Agents and abides by its code of conduct.
